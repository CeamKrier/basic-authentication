# Getting Started

A basic web application to showcase an account sing-up flow with react.

## Running

You can start both api and ui with a single command:

`npm run startAll`

This will install the necessary dependencies of both UI and API then start them both.

Also, you can individually start API:

`npm run startUi`

And UI:

`npm run startApi`
